# ðŸŽ§ Smart Spotify Playlist Splitter

Cross-platform experience (Express backend + React Native mobile app) that surfaces your Spotify playlists, enriches track metadata with genres, and can auto-build new playlists by genre via the **Smart Split** workflow.

## Highlights
- **Spotify OAuth** (authorization code flow) handled by the Express backend.
- **Playlist explorer**: browse every playlist and inspect full track metadata (song, artist, album, inferred genre).
- **Genre enrichment**: pulls artist genres from Spotify and backfills gaps with the Google Gemini API when configured.
- **Smart Split automation**: preview genre-based splits for any playlist, rename the proposed lists, then create them in Spotify with a tap.
- **React Native (Expo)** mobile client for a polished on-the-go experience.

## Project Structure
```
backend/   # Express + TypeScript API server
mobile/    # React Native (Expo) client
```

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.18+ and npm
- Spotify Developer account with a registered application
- Google Gemini API key (optional, but required for AI genre backfilling)
- For mobile development: Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`) and an emulator or the Expo Go app

## Backend Setup (`backend/`)
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update `.env` with your credentials:
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` / `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: from the Spotify developer dashboard
   - `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`: must match the URL registered with Spotify (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/auth/callback`)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: required to enrich missing genres
   - `CLIENT_URL`: origin allowed by CORS (e.g. the Expo dev tunnel URL)

3. Run the server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The API listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

4. Run unit tests
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
   The Jest suite runs with `NODE_ENV=test`, loading values from `.env.test` if present (copy `backend/.env.test.example` to `backend/.env.test` to customise).

> **Tip:** All Spotify/Gemini calls are mocked/stubbed in the tests, so you can run them without live credentials.

### Live integration checks (optional)
If you want to verify real API connectivity, dedicated integration suites are available. These are **disabled by default** and require real credentials:

```bash
# Spotify (needs a valid user access token with playlist scopes)
export SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<copy token>"
npx jest test/spotifyService.integration.test.ts --runInBand

# Google Gemini (needs GEMINI_API_KEY in environment or .env.test)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="<your gemini key>"
npx jest test/geminiService.integration.test.ts --runInBand
```

Both integration tests skip automatically if the required environment variable is missing. Tokens expire, so refresh them before re-running.

### Key API Routes
| Route | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/auth/start` | POST | Initiate Spotify OAuth, returns authorize URL & session state |
| `/auth/callback` | GET | Spotify redirect target â€“ exchanges code for tokens |
| `/auth/session/:state` | GET | Consume stored tokens (used by the mobile app) |
| `/auth/refresh` | POST | Refresh a Spotify access token |
| `/users/me` | GET | Current Spotify profile |
| `/playlists` | GET | List playlists (summary) |
| `/playlists/:id` | GET | Playlist details with genre-enriched tracks |
| `/smart-split/:id/preview` | GET | Genre-based split preview |
| `/smart-split/:id/apply` | POST | Create the selected split playlists |

---

## Mobile Setup (`mobile/`)
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure Expo project
   - Update `app.json` â†’ `expo.extra.apiUrl` if your backend is not on `http://localhost:4000`.
   - Ensure the custom scheme (`smartspotify`) is listed in your Spotify appâ€™s **Redirect URIs** as `smartspotify://auth-callback`.

3. Start Expo
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   Open the Expo app (or emulator) and load the project.

### Authentication Flow (Mobile)
1. Mobile calls `POST /auth/start` and receives Spotifyâ€™s authorize URL + a state token.
2. Expo opens the Spotify consent screen in a secure browser session.
3. After approval, Spotify redirects to the backend (`/auth/callback`) which stores tokens and forwards to the Expo deep link (`smartspotify://auth-callback?state=...`).
4. The app consumes the state via `/auth/session/:state`, caches access/refresh tokens, and keeps them fresh with `/auth/refresh`.

### Smart Split Flow
1. Open a playlist and tap **Smart Split by Genre**.
2. The app calls `/smart-split/:playlistId/preview` â€“ the backend groups tracks by genre and suggests playlist names.
3. Toggle which splits to create, tweak the names if desired, then hit **Create Selected Playlists**.
4. The backend creates new Spotify playlists (private by default) and populates them with the genre tracks.

## Development Tips
- The backend stores OAuth sessions in memory for simplicity. In production, replace `sessionStore` with a persistent solution (Redis, DB, etc.).
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is optional; when absent, missing genres remain `Unknown`.
- Adjust Spotify scopes via `SPOTIFY_SCOPES` if you need more privileges.
- The React Native client currently stores tokens in-memory. Add secure storage if you need persistence across app restarts.

## Next Steps
- Add automated tests (backend unit/integration, mobile UI tests).
- Harden error handling and introduce structured logging/monitoring.
- Persist user sessions and playlists in a database for analytics.

Enjoy building smarter Spotify playlists! ðŸŽ¶
